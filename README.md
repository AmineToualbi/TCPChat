# TCPChat

TCPChat is a C++ Client-Server project allowing multiple connected users to communicate and exchange messages. 


# Implementation

The software is divided into two separate programs, a server and a client project. The client-server architecture was developed using Winsock.


# Run the Program

To run this program, you need Visual Studio C++. Download the program and run the server first. Once the client is up and running, open as many clients as you want and start chatting! 

For testing purposes, the IP address of the server is set to 127.0.0.1, which is the local host. If the need be, you can change it to a specific IP address.
