/*
	Steps to set up a Winsock server (from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winsock/winsock-server-application):
		- Initializing Winsock. 
		- Creating a listening socket for the server. 
		- Binding that listening socket to the server IP address & listening port. 
			-> we use a sockaddr_in structure for this matter.
		- Accept a connection from a client. 
			-> once a connection is established, the recv() function is used to receive data from that specific client. 
		- Receive & send data. 
		- Disconnect server once everything is done. 

	To handle multiple clients on the server without using multithreading, I used the select() function.
	(from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/socket-programming-in-cc-handling-multiple-clients-on-server-without-multi-threading/)
		- Select allows to store multiple active sockets inside a file descriptor. 
		- Select will detect if a socket gets activated. 
			-> when a socket is "activated", two things can happen: 
				1. If the socket is the listening socket, it means that a new client is trying to connect to the server. 
				2. If not, it means a connected client is sending data.
