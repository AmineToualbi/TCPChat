/*
	Steps to set up a Winsock client (from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/winsock/winsock-client-application):
		- Creating a socket. 
		- Connect that socket to the IP address & port of the server. 
			-> IP address & port of the server are stored in the sockaddr_in variable, hint. 
		- Sending & receiving the data on the client. 
			-> For the receiving part, we use an external thread to continuously receive data. 
			-> For the sending part, we continuously check for input & send the message when the user presses enter. 
				-> this part is done in the main.cpp file. 
		- Disconnect client.
